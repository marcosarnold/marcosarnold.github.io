  <p>
  I am a third year Computer Science and Sociology double major at <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/"
  target="_blank">Colorado College</a> with interests at the intersection of technology, culture, and social
  impact. My work focuses on designing and studying digital systems that center marginalized voices through
  music, media, and cultural production. I am currently researching augmentative and alternative communication
  (AAC) and human computer interaction for adults with cognitive disabilities in Colorado with 
  <a href="https://koushikvarsha.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Varsha Koushik</a>. Broadly, I am
  interested in how computing, data, and platform design can be used to build more inclusive, accountable, and
  community centered digital spaces.
